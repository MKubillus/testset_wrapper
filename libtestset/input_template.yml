    # energies.
    type: "reaction"
    reactions:  # List reactions for the testset
      # Reaction equations all need a stochiometric factor (1 is assumed if
      # none given) and all reactants are separated by the plus ("+") sign.
      # Products and educts are separated by the reaction arrow ("->").
      # For molecule names use the xyz file names without the ".xyz" suffix.
